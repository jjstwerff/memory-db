Transactions in local thread:
	Map<Pair<Index, Record>, Record> transaction;
	This returns the records that follow on a record in the table.. null support for first record,
	Records can follow a record in a transaction.
	Null value for a delete with the current record as key.
	When needed create a special 'null' instance of the record.
	Commit/Rollback support

RecordInterface:
	Array = lazy.. do not calculate more elements than are reached by 'next()'.. could still read old elements
	Object = efficient scanName(string) implementation, not specifically lazy
