	java code generation via JSTL
- Meta format:
	always claim main record in Store, no claimed indexes
	make index to array possible: position in array as data, for now no combination of relation & position possible
	relation to array value: position of array & register it for removal .. only from parent
- minimal tests for each validation check and each calculated field
- separate layer for JSON data to still allow for code generated lower levels
- better errors on getting fields from array without index
- remove as many reserved field names as possible
- algorithm to remove relations on deletes of records
	more efficient when indexes exist

JSLT:
- write set of files from output = [ { path, content, problems? } ]
- allow simple type casting via macro parameters (long -> double)
- add more type information from expressions
- object unwinding in macro definitions
- array unwinding in macro definitions
- string unwinding in macro definitions

- add * to jpath ... only 1 level object
- add [*] to jpath .. only 1 level array
- add .. to jpath .. possibly more than 1 level
- allow string align
- allow numeric layout & align, also via expressions
- allow date layout & align
- documentation of RecordInterface, ChangeInterface
- output from a script can define the input of another script
- sync back to database
- introduce local variables
- global named definitions.. possibly from context

TODO:
- introduce indexes as RadixTrees.
- spatial layouts:
	bounding boxes with content boxes
	QuadTree = split space in two in different dimensions.. allow empty elements that do not split
	Radix tree with bits interleaved between dimensions
- unit test deletes
- Clear current ARRAY values when parsing them from data
- Correct parser of multi-layered Relations: unit-test them
	test changes to indexes due to change of relation
		reuse the Change<Record> if possible and start a new one when not.. find correct check for it
	write new unittest to validate index positions after relation change

- validate that each record is linked somewhere:
	has it's own index
	or has a parent record
	or is in use as an Array record
	more information in Index definition: primary
- allow min/max/undefined fields on numbers and use only needed bits
- more compact records by defer bit packing to later.. an lowest number of bits at last
- allow fields that point to the same ARRAY record definition to have the same name
    or at least error on the occurrence
- correct Store use:
	show number of top level indexes.. claim space for them in Store
- validate writing escaped data into multi-line strings.. do not escape , or } or /n but do the rest
	more efficient code to write data.. do not try to fined \t or , tokens in each string that cannot contain them
- pure memory-map version for store.strings UTF8 for efficiency
- free-space maintenance thread:
	start new toFree index for continued functionality but keep top for current loop
	iterate through whole structure & set pointers to free objects to actually null
		use output routine with a custom Writer that un-sets pointers to freed records
	move toFree records on the working list to actual free records
	combine freed spaces
- document all public classes and methods.

- implement a session that stores the internal records in a malloc space and writes them to the real store on commit
	test the commit on a simple case
	test a single index that can hold new, changed and old records
	test the same data after a commit
	test removed records
	negative record numbers indicate a session store
	test writing the session change data to string
	test reading this session data into a separate database
- implement a multi-layered session that commits on the lower one
	allow second level session stores where the most upper bit is the store indicator

- new SUB type: as related record field.. keep space of whole record on parent
- optional fields linked with single enumerate value
	during claim keep structure of all free bits instead of 1 position
- create JSON writer/parser back-end
- write general JSON data parser into the database.. use this to write parser from JSON

- luxe iterator:
	prevent showing mutated records that get inserted after the current
		IntSet of records that are changed.. do not show them again
    concurrent modifications
    	modCount on structure.. 
    		only position is next to top.. only on set and let indexes point to the same number
    		optional (unit-test environment)
    		optional inside store.. more strict but functional
    	insert/delete/clear/resize increases modCount
    	iterator remembers initial modCount & remembers on own remove

- later in array:
	remove().. move records internally & lower size
	remove(index).. move records internally & lower size
	add(index).. create space of number of records


*** further development ***
- Reader using the own type data structures

- unit test on server: for now only in unit test environment
	define unit test structure
		test.. input & output & changes
		input
			data: datafile in multiline string = input
			session(moment, label)
			commit
			read: path to element = output
				$.store.book[0].title
				path + * for all children
				path + [state=text,name>123]: filter in path: 'and' / 'or' / '<=' / 'like()' / [0] = first / [-1] = last / [-3:-1]: last 3
			json output/input.. json templates:
				element = $[path]
				for-each(path + filter)
				for-each(path + filter, sort)
				if (filter) .. else .. 
				macro
				var(name, path)
			data change through input.. checks
	return record structure
	return record data
	change record in session & validate that indexes return the last version
	show changes
	add record
	validate that the new record is returned in the indexes
	delete record
	validate that this record is removed from the indexes
	sort records
	page records
	filter records

- transaction session:
	verify
		temporary copy of mapping
		verify session store
		loop session in logical order
			validate existence in mapping of change/delete records
		remove remainder mappings

- validate actual number of objects created: verify JAVA-8 on stack objects
	jmap -dump:format=b,file=cheap.bin <pid>
	jhat
